Hello, I want to make a small website that helps you find teams that rotate well in the UCL Fantasy game. A team rotates well with another team when within the same gameweek they play on different dates. In the assets folder I have a file #file:dates.csv which lists for each team, on which dates they play each gameweek.

On the webpage I want to have

A dropdown menu, that allows you to select a team. I would like to be able to also type into the box to filter teams
Be able to set a starting Gameweek, from 1 to 8, and a final gameweek from 1 to 8. Final gameweek must always be higher than the starting gameweek
Once the options are selected, I want to show the user which teams rotate well with the selected teams. Meaning which teams within the starting and final gameweek never play on the same date as the team chosen in the dropdown menu.

Please try to keep code separated into their own modules instead of placing everything in one big module. All styling should be done using css as much as possible.

The website will eventually be published via github pages. Keep this in mind.

Please start by generating a project plan for this website. Place this plan in a markdown file in the docs folder (to be created).
